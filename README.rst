Scrape-Fu
=========

This repo contains some more or less fun projects related to web scraping:

- **Freebora** is downloads free ebooks from O'Reilly.
- **Foe** tries doing something similar using Scrapy (unfinished).
- **Hidemyass** reads a table of proxy servers, where the provider tries to prevent this to happen.

**Please note**: the freebora project will move into a separate repo github.com/deeplook/freebora, soon.
